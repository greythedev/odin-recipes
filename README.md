# odin-recipes

This project is a simple recipe static website that is made using lessons and skills that were learned from the Odin Project open-source course.

This project is developed using the tools below.

- Git
- Git Hub
- Neovim

This website includes 2 page types.

Home is the index page that lists all dishes with links to their respective recipe page.

Recipes are the pages that are dedicated for the dishes listed in the Home page.
It includes the required ingredients and steps in completing the dishes.

This introductory project helped my understanding in basic html tags, lists, and linkings.
